        <h3>Here's a time line of Areu's Remarkable life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>2000/10/05 </strong>- The beginning of Rue. Rue was born on October 5. 2000 at 5pm in the afternoon.</li>
          <li><strong>2000/11/20 </strong>- Home Coming, the day of reckoning. On the day she came home she was so tiny that she could fit in your hands. She was technically the runt of the litter. </li>
          <li><strong>2000/11/21 </strong>- Anyone for a basket? While Rue was little, her favorite place to sleep for the first few weeks was in a tiny wicker basket. A basket like you would use for Easter egg hunting.</li>
          <li><strong>2001/01/15 </strong>- The Naming. On the first night home we had placed our new family member safely away in her kennel. After listening to her cry out Arue.... Arue... our hearts could no longer take it and we brought her to bed. Oh and the name kind of stuck after that.</li>
          <li><strong>2001/07/02 </strong>- Cyber-pup. As Rue grew she showed problem signs in her back legs. This would be the start of several years of surgery to improve her quality of life. She was complete missing a hip shelf (no hip socket) on one side and a lose socket on the other. </li>
          <li><strong>2003/09/15 </strong>- Making Friends. Rue had a lot of down time for the first few years while she recovered from her surgeries. Because of her nature she drew people to her. She had friends from clinics and people we met from our walks. People new her by name and would ask about her.</li>
          <li><strong>2004/03/08 </strong>- Play. Play was simple a ball. But we also kept a large collection of stuffed animals that she kept track of and played with. She took very good care of her toys.</li>
          <li><strong>2008/09/03 </strong>- Kink in my neck. We enjoyed many years after Rues first health issues. But as she got to be around 8 years old her neck disks ruptured. She was now a paraplegic. Like always we ran to our doctors and were informed that they could try and perform surgery to fix the problem but that she would never walk again but she would be at least be able to move her head. After the surgeries and a couple of weeks of recovery Rue just decided to stand up one day to get one of her stuffed toys. Well I guess she can walk. Surprised everyone including the doctors.</li>
          <li><strong>2010/08/05 </strong>- The Final years. We had two more great years with Rue before she came down with cancer. The cancer was in her spinal column. There was nothing the doctors could do for her. We kept her comfortable until we felt she was no longer happy. Rue wanted to live and we wanted to give her as much time as we could.</li>
          <li><strong>2010/10/12 </strong>- The day me heart stopped working. Rue's cancer was extremely aggressive and we did not have much time with her after diagnosis. On October 2010 we put her to sleep. Even now it still breaks my heart. It sounds like Rue was a train wreck from everything I have mentioned but she make everyone around her want to try. She made people smile. She is missed.</li>
